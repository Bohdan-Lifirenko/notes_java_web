### In web programming, **origin** means:

A combination of three things:

1. **Scheme (protocol)** → `http://` or `https://`
2. **Host (domain or IP)** → e.g. `example.com`
3. **Port** → e.g. `:80`, `:443`, `:3000`

So, the **origin** is basically:

```
protocol + domain + port
```

---

### Examples

* `https://example.com:443` → origin = `https + example.com + 443`
* `http://example.com:80` → different origin (because the protocol is different).
* `https://sub.example.com` → different origin (because the subdomain is different).
* `https://example.com:3000` → different origin (because the port is different).

### Why it matters

Browsers compare the origin of:

* The **page that’s running the script**
  vs.
* The **resource it’s trying to load**

If they don’t match, it’s called a **cross-origin request**, and CORS rules apply.

👉 Do you want me to show you a **visual diagram** that compares same-origin vs cross-origin examples?
