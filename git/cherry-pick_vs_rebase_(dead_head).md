Good question 👍 The difference between **cherry-pick** and **rebase** in your case comes down to:

---

### 🔹 `git cherry-pick <commit>`

* Takes **just one (or more) specific commits** and copies them onto the current branch tip.
* The commit gets a **new hash** (because it’s recreated in a new place).
* Other commits in between your "old commit" and the branch tip are **not touched**.
* History of the branch stays as-is, you’re just “grafting” your new commit onto the end.

✅ Use when:
You only want **that one new commit** on top of the branch.

---

### 🔹 `git rebase temp`

* Moves the **entire sequence of commits** from your "detached place" and **replays them** onto the tip of `temp`.
* If you only have **one new commit**, the result looks the same as cherry-pick.
* If you had made **multiple commits** since the older checkout, rebase would replay **all of them in order**.
* Rebasing can also try to resolve conflicts in sequence.

✅ Use when:
You want to **preserve all commits made since you checked out the old commit**, and transplant them to the current end of `temp`.

### ⚡ Example

Suppose `temp` looked like this:

```
A -- B -- C -- D   (temp)
       \
        E          (your new commit from old B)
```

* **Cherry-pick E onto D** →

```
A -- B -- C -- D -- E'
```

(E' = copy of E, new hash)

* **Rebase E onto D** →

```
A -- B -- C -- D -- E'
```

(same result, since only one commit)

But if you had `E -- F -- G` made after checkout:

* **Cherry-pick E, F, G individually** →

```
A -- B -- C -- D -- E' -- F' -- G'
```

* **Rebase starting from E** → same result, but in one command.

---

👉 So in *your case with one commit*, **both cherry-pick and rebase produce the same history**.
The difference only matters if you had multiple new commits.

Do you want me to show the exact commands you’d run if you had **several commits** instead of just one?
