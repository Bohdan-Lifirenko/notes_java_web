I’ll fix your sentence first:
👉 *“If I accidentally added `.idea` to my commit, but now I’m way ahead on the branch, can I somehow unstage it or stop seeing changes in this folder? Because even if I add it to the `.gitignore` file, I still see them in my IntelliJ IDEA Git commits window.”*

---

This happens because:

* Once files are **already tracked by Git** (committed at least once), adding them to `.gitignore` won’t stop Git from noticing changes.
* `.gitignore` only prevents *new, untracked files* from being added.

### ✅ To stop tracking `.idea` but keep it locally

1. Remove the folder from Git’s index (staging area) but keep it on disk:

   ```bash
   git rm -r --cached .idea
   ```
2. Commit that change:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Stop tracking .idea folder"
   ```
3. Make sure `.gitignore` has `.idea/` in it:

   ```
   .idea/
   ```

Now Git will stop tracking changes inside `.idea`. IntelliJ’s commit window will no longer show them.

⚠️ But since you said you are **“way ahead on the branch”**, this will **not remove the `.idea` folder from past commits** — only from future ones. That’s usually fine, and it’s the safest approach.

If you actually want to **purge `.idea` from all history** (e.g., for open-source repos), you’d need to rewrite history with `git filter-repo` or `git filter-branch`. But that can break things if the branch is already shared.

---

Do you want to *just ignore `.idea` going forward*, or do you also want to **remove it from past commits** so it never existed in history?
