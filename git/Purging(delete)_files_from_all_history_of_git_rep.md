Perfect üëç I‚Äôll give you a **step-by-step safe script** so you can purge `.idea` from your repo history but keep a backup in case something goes wrong.

---

### üõ° Safe script to purge `.idea` from Git history

1. **Backup your repo first**

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   cd ..
   cp -r your-repo your-repo-backup
   ```

   Now you have a `your-repo-backup/` folder with the original untouched history.

2. **Install `git-filter-repo`** (if not installed)

   ```bash
   pip install git-filter-repo
   ```

   or, if you use Linux and have package managers:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install git-filter-repo
   ```

   (For Windows: download it from [GitHub](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) and put it in your PATH.)

3. **Run filter-repo to purge `.idea`**
   Inside your repo folder:

   ```bash
   git filter-repo --path .idea --invert-paths
   ```

   * `--path .idea` ‚Üí selects the `.idea` folder.
   * `--invert-paths` ‚Üí removes it instead of keeping it.
     This rewrites the history and deletes `.idea` from every commit.

4. **Add `.idea` to `.gitignore`** so it won‚Äôt come back:

   ```bash
   echo ".idea/" >> .gitignore
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Add .idea to .gitignore"
   ```

5. **Force push the cleaned history** (‚ö†Ô∏è this overwrites remote history):

   ```bash
   git push origin main --force
   ```

   *(replace `main` with your branch name)*

6. **Tell collaborators** (if any) to re-clone the repo, because history has changed.

---

‚úÖ After this:

* `.idea` will be completely gone from all commits.
* Your repo size will shrink if `.idea` contained lots of metadata.
* Future commits won‚Äôt track `.idea` anymore.

---

Do you want me to also show you a way to **check if `.idea` is really gone from history** before you push?

Ah! Now it‚Äôs clear what‚Äôs happening. Let me explain and fix it.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What happened

1. You cloned your repo into:

```
~/IdeaProjects/park-project_clone/park-project
```

Git created a folder inside called `park-project/`, so your actual repo is now at:

```
~/IdeaProjects/park-project_clone/park-project/park-project
```

That's why at first `git remote -v` and `git status` failed‚Äîyou were **one level above the real Git repository**.

2. You ran `git filter-repo`.

**Important:** `git filter-repo` **removes the `origin` remote by default** to avoid accidentally pushing rewritten history to the original remote. That‚Äôs why after the command, `git remote -v` is gone and `git push` fails.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ How to fix it

You just need to **re-add your remote**:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Bohdan-Lifirenko/park-project.git
```

Check it:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see:

```
origin  https://github.com/Bohdan-Lifirenko/park-project.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Bohdan-Lifirenko/park-project.git (push)
```

Then you can safely **force push your rewritten history**:

```bash
git push origin master --force
```

---

### ‚úÖ Optional tips

* Always **run Git commands inside the folder that contains `.git`**, not one level above.
* After using `git filter-repo`, the remote is removed on purpose. You always need to re-add it before pushing.

---

If you want, I can give a **short step-by-step command list** that safely removes `.idea` and pushes to GitHub from your current setup.

Do you want me to do that?

Good question! Let me rephrase it clearly:
üëâ *‚ÄúDoes `git filter-repo --path .idea --invert-paths` change other branches connected to the one I‚Äôm changing too?‚Äù*

---

### The short answer:

**Yes ‚Äî by default, `git filter-repo` rewrites all branches and tags** in your repository.

* It **does not just affect the current branch**.
* Every branch and tag that contains the `.idea` folder will have its history rewritten to remove it.
* That‚Äôs why after running it, your remotes are removed ‚Äî Git is warning you that **all history changed**, not just `master`.

---

### Important implications:

1. **Force-push needed**
   Since all branches are rewritten, if you push any branch to a remote, you must use `--force`.

2. **Shared repos caution**
   If anyone else has cloned this repository, their local branches will conflict with the rewritten history. They will need to re-clone or reset their branches.

3. **If you want to restrict changes**
   You can limit `git filter-repo` to just the current branch:

   ```bash
   git filter-repo --refs master --path .idea --invert-paths
   ```

   This will only rewrite the `master` branch. Replace `master` with the branch name you want.

---

So yes, by default it touches **all branches and tags**, but you can limit it if needed.

I can write the **exact command to safely remove `.idea` from just your current branch** without touching others if you want. Do you want me to do that?
