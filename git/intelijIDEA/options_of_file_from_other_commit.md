Nice — those options you see in IntelliJ IDEA’s context menu are **Git operations**, but the IDE names them a bit differently from the CLI. Let me break them down so you can match them to what we discussed:

---

## 🔹 **Revert**

* In IntelliJ this usually means **discard local changes** to the selected file and restore it to the last committed state (in your current branch).
* Equivalent to:

  ```bash
  git checkout -- path/to/file
  ```

  or (modern Git):

  ```bash
  git restore path/to/file
  ```

⚠️ Note: This is not the same as `git revert` for commits — IntelliJ’s "Revert" on a file level is more like “undo my local edits.”

---

## 🔹 **Cherry-Pick**

* Apply an **entire commit** from history (or another branch) onto your current branch.
* Equivalent to:

  ```bash
  git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
  ```
* IntelliJ makes this easy: right-click a commit in the log → *Cherry-pick*.

---

## 🔹 **Create Patch**

* Makes a `.patch` file that represents the difference between commits (or between working tree and a commit).
* Equivalent to:

  ```bash
  git diff > my-changes.patch
  ```
* You (or someone else) can later apply it with:

  ```bash
  git apply my-changes.patch
  ```
* Useful for sharing changes without pushing to a remote.

---

## 🔹 **Get from Revision**

* Lets you take a file (or folder) from a specific **revision (commit, branch, tag)** and copy it into your working directory.
* Equivalent to:

  ```bash
  git checkout <revision> -- path/to/file
  ```

  or (modern Git):

  ```bash
  git restore --source <revision> path/to/file
  ```

This is exactly the feature you were asking about earlier ("get file from newer commit while on an older one").

---

## ✅ Quick analogy

* **Revert (file)** = throw away my local edits → go back to last commit.
* **Cherry-pick** = bring an entire commit from elsewhere into my current branch.
* **Create Patch** = export my changes into a `.patch` file for reuse.
* **Get from Revision** = grab just one file (or folder) as it was in a specific commit.

Do you want me to also map **IntelliJ’s “Revert commit” in the log** vs **“Revert file” in the editor**? They look the same in name but do *very different* things.
