Great question 👍 This goes deep into **Git’s commit / staging model**. Let’s break it down step by step.

---

## 🔹 Git has three "areas"

1. **Working Directory** → the files on disk (your actual code).
2. **Staging Area (Index)** → files marked as "ready for the next commit".
3. **Repository (Commits / HEAD)** → the actual commit history.

---

## 🔹 Reset types

When you do `git reset <mode> HEAD~1`, you’re telling Git:
“Move `HEAD` and branch pointer back by one commit, and then decide what to do with the **staging area** and **working directory**.”

### 1. **--soft**

* Moves branch pointer back.
* **Keeps changes staged** (in the index).
* Useful if you want to "redo" the last commit (e.g., wrong message, forgot a file).

👉 Example:

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

Result:

* Commit undone.
* Changes still staged (ready for commit).

---

### 2. **--mixed** (default)

* Moves branch pointer back.
* **Unstages changes** (but keeps them in working directory).
* Files appear as "modified but not staged".

👉 Example:

```bash
git reset --mixed HEAD~1
```

Result:

* Commit undone.
* Changes remain, but you need `git add` again before committing.

---

### 3. **--hard**

* Moves branch pointer back.
* **Deletes all changes** (both staged and unstaged).
* Working directory matches the commit you reset to.

👉 Example:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

Result:

* Commit undone.
* Code changes gone. (⚠️ irreversible unless you saved the commit hash).

---

## 🔹 Staged vs Unstaged

* **Staged** → file is in the index (added with `git add`). It will be included in the next commit.
* **Unstaged** → file is modified in working directory but not yet added with `git add`. It won’t be included in the next commit.

👉 Example flow:

```bash
echo "hi" > file.txt
git status
# file.txt is unstaged (modified)

git add file.txt
git status
# file.txt is staged (ready to commit)
```

---

✅ Quick mental model:

* **soft** = undo commit, keep staged
* **mixed** = undo commit, keep unstaged
* **hard** = undo commit, erase changes

---

Do you want me to make a **visual diagram** showing how files move between *working → staged → commit* with these reset modes? That usually makes it super clear.
