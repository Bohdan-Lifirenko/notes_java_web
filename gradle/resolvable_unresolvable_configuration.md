Great question 👍 Let’s break it down in simple terms.

In **Gradle**, every dependency is added to a **configuration** (for example, `implementation`, `runtimeOnly`, `compileClasspath`, etc.).
Configurations define **two roles** in the build:

1. **Resolvable configurations** → used to **resolve** dependencies (download JARs, look up transitive dependencies, etc.).

   * Example: `runtimeClasspath`
   * When you run your app, Gradle needs the actual `.jar` files of your dependencies. The configuration tells Gradle:

     > “Hey, I need these dependencies **as files**, please fetch them.”

   ✔️ These are resolvable because Gradle can turn the dependency declarations into a set of files.

---

2. **Unresolvable configurations** → used only for **declaring** dependencies, not for directly resolving them.

   * Example: `implementation`, `api`
   * You declare dependencies here so they can be **consumed by other configurations**, but you cannot ask Gradle:

     > `implementation.resolve()` → ❌ (doesn’t make sense, because `implementation` is just an input for others).

   ✔️ These are unresolvable because they only **contribute to other resolvable configurations** (like `compileClasspath`).

---

### Analogy 🛠️

* **Unresolvable configuration**: A shopping list (`implementation`, `api`).
* **Resolvable configuration**: The actual bag of groceries you bring home (`runtimeClasspath`, `compileClasspath`).

You don’t eat the shopping list directly 🍎 — it only feeds into the bag of groceries you can actually consume.

### Example in a Gradle project

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.google.guava:guava:31.1-jre'
    runtimeOnly 'ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:1.4.7'
}

tasks.register("printClasspath") {
    doLast {
        println(configurations.runtimeClasspath.asPath) // ✅ resolvable
        println(configurations.implementation.canBeResolved) // ❌ false
        println(configurations.runtimeClasspath.canBeResolved) // ✅ true
    }
}
```

Output would show:

* `implementation.canBeResolved = false` (unresolvable)
* `runtimeClasspath.canBeResolved = true` (resolvable)

---

👉 In short:

* **Resolvable** = can produce a set of files (used at build/runtime/test execution).
* **Unresolvable** = only for declaring/structuring dependencies, not for direct resolution.

---

Would you like me to also explain **how Gradle decides which configuration extends which** (e.g., how `implementation` contributes to `compileClasspath`)?
